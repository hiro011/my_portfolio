                This project is to make a disscussion forum website.
                A discussion forum is a forum website that people can use 
                to discuss different topics. Users can add a discussion topic
                and can attach an image, and by clicking the discussion any user can 
                add comments. discussion can be upvoted or downvoted while comments
                are liked or just leave. I used laravel livewire to make this project.

                <strong> My role in the project </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I made this project solo. I made this project mostly from watching 
                tutorial youtube videos, and I have added some exciting features later on.
            </p> 
            <p class="portfolio_individual-title">
                <strong>Problems encountered and their solutions</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Adding profile: </strong>
				was hard a bit hard for me, I know how to add a profile for logged
				user but for non-logged users who posted before, showing their profile
				after was a bit challenging especially I didn't know about model 
				relationship but after rewatching the video I figured
				out how to get user data to display.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Adding Votes and Likes: </strong>
				votes and likes are essential for social media so I wanted to add that
                this feature was solely mine it wasn't in the tutorial video. I made table
                to add users and the liked image id, and I tried to use relationships like 
                I did with the profile to display the liked icon but their relationship was a bit 
                complex, so after some googling and stack overflowing I found out how to 
                select the liked image id in the collection and check if it contains this image id and it worked. But voting was kind of different because
                use can upvote or downvote while only like comments, so I needed to know 
                first, I need to know if the user voted or not which I solved before, and second
                I have to know if the user upvote or downvote for that I collect the ids and 
                used loop and checked if it is up(1) or down(0) vote and it worked.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Live search: </strong>
				The most amazing thing I loved about livewire is its single page
                application which means you don't need to refresh to see your change
                it will show you live. so I loved live search but I couldn't do complex
                coding to do it so I use a simple live search but I am unable to search
                the user's name which was dissappointing for me it only search the body 
                or the text content.
            </p>
